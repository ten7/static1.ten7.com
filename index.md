title:  TEN7 Contractor’s Quick Start
opener: Introduction
---

Hello, and welcome! This is a guide to contracting with [TEN7](https://ten7.com/).  Our goal is to get you up and running quickly and to answer any questions you have before getting started on the team.

Our mission is to [Make Things That Matter](https://ten7.com/mission) --- and if you happen to be looking for our official Employee Handbook, that’s over at [handbook.ten7.com](https://handbook.ten7.com/). 

## So we’d like to work with you, what’s next?

*   First thing’s first: we’ll need to run a Goodhire or Certn (if you’re outside the US) background check. We’ll need your full name and email address to get started, and you’ll fill out the rest. You’ll be asked to enter our official office location, so please use: Minneapolis, MN, 55403, Hennepin County. If all is clear 🤞, we will ask you to...
    *   Fill out and sign a TEN7 independent contractor agreement and a W9 
    *   Set up Gusto, so we can pay you
    *   Fill out the Know Your Team ice breaker --- the team will learn about you, and vice versa
    *   Log in to Slack and add your profile photo and your personal pronouns in parentheses next to your "full name," so we know who you are. Then say hi! 👋🏻
*   In the meantime, we will get you set up with... 
    *   An employee number
    *   Your new ten7.com email address. **Important:** please log in and set up two-factor authentication (2FA) in the first week of contracting to avoid getting locked out of your new email account.
    *   Other accounts, such as: Jira, Notion, Slack, Harvest, 1Password, Git, and more
    

## We know you must have loads of questions! We have answers.

Please know that — depending on your role — someone will talk you through our process in more detail before you dive into the work. We’ve divided our answers up into:

* [Administrative](/admin.html)
* [Time Tracking and Payment](/time.html)
* [Process](/process.html)
* [Developer Specific](/developer.html)


## Good luck!

We wish you the best of luck in your first hours and days with us at TEN7. Know that we’re glad to have you on board, and that we look forward to getting to know you better. Still have questions? Feel free to reach out to [Dani Adelman](https://ten7.slack.com/team/UKEQ8DH9T), our Director of Operations. 

You can also contact our CEO, Ivan Stegic, directly as much as you need via Slack, email, or even with a phone call! This could be a random call to say, “Hi!” or to tell him that things are bonkers, and you need help. You name it, he’s available whenever you are. His mobile number is on his [Slack profile.](https://ten7.slack.com/team/U02FLV1A0)
